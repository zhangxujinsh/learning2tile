#Introducing Tiling Membership.

== Tile ID ==
Each tile in the base screen has an unique integer ID starting from 0. Different types of base screen (e.g. rectangle and diamond) has the ID assignment pattern. To see the tile ID for a base screen using the following command:
<code language="R">
txyc_matrix = as.matrix(expand.grid(1:500,1:333))
base_tiling = TilingRectangle(4,4, txyc_matrix, 500, 333) #generate the base screen
PlotTiling(txyc_matrix, base_tiling, plot.id = TRUE)
</code>
The following figure would be displayed and to save the figure using
<code language="R">
SaveTilingPlot(txyc_matrix, base_tiling, plot.id = TRUE, "4x4_rectangle_id.png")
</code>
We list the ID for all base screens:
|| *Base screen* || *Tile ID* ||
|| rectangle|| [http://learning2tile.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/4x4_rectangle_id.png] ||
|| diamond|| [http://learning2tile.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/5x5_diamond_id.png]||
|| hexagon||[http://learning2tile.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/2.5_hexagon_id.png] ||

== Tiling Membership ==

The tiling membership is represented by a vector the dimension of which equals to the number of tiles generated by the tiling function. For example the 3x3 *tiling parameter = c(3,3)* rectangle tiling yields a 9-dimensional vector.

The *integer* in each dimension indicates the membership of the current tiles. If no tiling membership is applied, the default tiling membership is set to (0,...(m-1)), where m is the number of tiles generated by the tiling function. *Note the tiling membership starts from 0.* In other words, each tiles has a unique membership.


=== Examples ===




To generate a tiling with a specific membership use the following code:

<code language="R">
txyc_matrix = as.matrix(expand.grid(1:500,1:333))
base_tiling = TilingRectangle(2,2, txyc_matrix, 500, 333) #generate the base tiling
tiling_membership = c(0, 1, 2, 0)
mytiling = TilingMembership(base_tiling, tiling_membership )
PlotTiling(txyc_matrix, mytiling)
</code>
The following tiling would be displayed:

[http://learning2tile.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/(0,1,2,0).png]

Let's try another example, in the context of the rectangle tiling with parameter 3x3, let's try to generate a tiling that has 3 row and 1 column (with parameter 3x1) by picking a suitable tiling membership parameter.
<code language="R">
txyc_matrix = as.matrix(expand.grid(1:500,1:333))
base_tiling = TilingRectangle(3,3, txyc_matrix, 500, 333) #generate the base tiling
tiling_membership = c(0,0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2)
mytiling = TilingMembership(base_tiling, tiling_membership )
PlotTiling(txyc_matrix, mytiling)
</code>
We will get the following figure:
